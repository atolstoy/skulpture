=== Known Bugs ===

While it is better to fix bugs instead of documenting them, this list still
gives an overview of some quirks I am aware of.  If you think you found a
bug not listed, please report it to: Christoph Feck <christoph@maxiom.de>


*** Icon Sizes ***

Skulpture does not respect the "Small" and "Dialog" (large) icon sizes from
System Settings in KDE 4.4. Instead, they always depend on the font size.


*** Message Box Icons ***

Skulpture does not show icons in standard message boxes with Qt versions
earlier than Qt 4.5.


*** Style Sheets ***

Skulpture currently only supports a limited set of styling options using Qt
style sheets.  In particular, it only supports solid colors in the palette.
