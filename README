Welcome to the humble Skulpture-five (and six!) repository...

What is it all about
This is a re-worked and partially updated code of the original Skulpture style 
that was once developed by Christoph Feck. Specifically, this repo is a continuation of the
[`skulpture-five`](https://github.com/cfeck/skulpture/tree/five) (a Qt5/KF5 port) branch from 2016.

What is available
As of now, the following features are present:
- an updated code base with fewer warnings during compilation
- Qt5 support
- Qt6 support

Dropped features
Compared to the original Skulpture style for KDE4, this version lacks the following features:
- no GUI for configuration tweaks (but `~/.config/SkulptureStyle.ini` is still supported)
- obviously no Kwin decorator part

Known issues
- Right now you can experience weird indents and paddings in menus, lists etc.

Motivation
The purpose of this repo is to provide a working Qt6 port of Skulpture. Even though it's not pixel-perfect
copy of its namesake for KDE4, it already provides great consistency between Qt5 and Qt6 apps. As the time goes by,
more and more apps are getting ported to Qt6 (qBittorrent, Strawberry etc), so that we need one style to fit 'em all.
Think of Skulpture as an alternative to Kvantum, which seems to be the only third-party style supporting both Qt5 and Qt6.
Your contribution and improvement in the Skulpture style will be strongly welcomed and appreciated!
